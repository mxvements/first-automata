little try of doing my first finite automata (DFA) after jvasquez's talk about them, here on 42madrid
this one accepts strings that may have leading/trailing zeroes and sequences of numbers that end and start with '1'
the accepted disctionary is {' ', '1', '0'}
examples:
"   100001"
"  101 111 111111000101 1001   "
etc

try if yourself!
